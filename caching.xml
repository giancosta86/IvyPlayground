<!--
This file can be included into other settings files -
as it provides a minimalist solution to Ivy's cache
problem.

In particular:

* The "resolutionCacheDir" is set to a project-private
  directory, ensuring that multiple projects can be
  built in parallel - for example, by a CI server
  like Jenkins. This directory, of course, should
  be ignore by version-control systems such as Git

* On the other hand, the "repositoryCacheDir" - which
  requires space as it contains the artifacts - is shared,
  but a NIO-based lock strategy is enforced to prevent
  cache corruption
-->
<ivy-settings>
   <caches
     resolutionCacheDir="${basedir}/.ivy-cache"
     repositoryCacheDir="${user.home}/.ivy2/repo-cache"
     lockStrategy="artifact-lock-nio" />
</ivy-settings>
